# Travis CI Testing Repo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/thirdgen88/travis-testing.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/thirdgen88/travis-testing)

I've only made this repo so I could test out some build configs and learn specific behaviors about Travis CI without borking my other projects' build configurations.  😝
